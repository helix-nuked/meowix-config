# meowix
Nix configuration but with a little bit of "meow"

### Stage: Development
Checklist

- [ ] Basic modular config
- [ ] Expand modular config
- [ ] Add multiple hosts support
- [ ] Optimized NixOS and same experience as CachyOS (1)
- [ ] Start fresh with no brain (2)
- [ ] No name commits (3)
- [ ] No nesting if possible (4)

(1) Preferably settings and performance, I tweaked before I got bombed with dotfile crap
(2) With restarted knowledge and/or from scratch
(3) I only use this config and focus more on code readabilty instead
(4) Because nesting led me problem to this, creating a new configuration
